         <p>Berserk is a dark fantasy manga series, created by Kentaro Miura in 1989. Miura worked on the series until he passed away in 2021, writing a total of 40 volumes. Currently Kouji Mori, one of Miura's lifelong friends, is continuing the series for him. Miura once told Mori the entire plot of Berserk in great detail. Because of this, Mori is currently the only person who knows the true ending of Berserk. Many who have read Berserk consider it to be one of the greatest manga ever written.</p>

        <p>Kentaro Miura had written four manga series before Berserk, none of which reaching near the acclamation that Berserk received. He also briefly worked on Hajime no Ippo as an assistant. Between 2006 and 2021, the manga went through multiple hiatuses, until Miura's death. Berserk has sold over 50 million volumes, making it the 45th best selling manga series of all time.</p>
